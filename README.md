### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**CathNeelamraju/CathNeelamraju** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a PhD student with the Reed Catchments Science Partnership (University of Queensland, Australia). I am working on methods to calculate and predict pesticide mixture toxicity for the Great Barrier Reef. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub - long time local R user but need to upskill.
